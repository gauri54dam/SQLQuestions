Growth of Airbnb

--Estimate the growth of Airbnb each year using the number of hosts registered as the growth metric.

--The rate of growth is calculated by taking (( no of hosts registered in the current year 
-- no of hosts registered in the previous year )/ the no of hosts registered in the previous tear) * 100

--Output the year, no of hosts in the current year, number of hosts in the previous year, and the current rate of growth.

--Round the rate of growth to the nearest percent and order the result in the ascending order based on the year.

Assume that the dataset consists only of unique hosts, meaning there are no duplicate hosts listed.

-- i/p Table : airbnb_search_details

-- o/p Table : year | no_of_hosts_curr | no_of_hosts_prev | rate


-- assumption - rate of growth for the first year? Ask interviewer about what should we do about such scenario? -- left join

-- get year | num_hosts - in one cte
-- left self join on prev_year = current_year - 1
-- get columns
-- growth rate 
-- order
