write a SQL query to find out the overall friend acceptance rate for each day.

-- input table friend_req : datestamp | sender | receiver | action = sent, accepted, rejected etc

-- output table - datestamp | rate = (accepted/total)*100

-- assumption - total = sent + accepted + rejected
select datestamp,
	count(case when action = 'accepted' then 1
	else null end) * 1.00 / count(action) *100 as perc_acceptance
from friend_req
group by datestamp

-- note
-- integer division by sql rounds the fraction and will not return -- real value hence use * 1.00
