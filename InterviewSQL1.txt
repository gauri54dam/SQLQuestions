1) Read a question slowly
2) State any assumptions that needs to be addressed to solve the question.
2) Write down the steps to solve the query on white board in simple english language.
3) Write the actual query.
4) Test the query.

-- Question1)
You are provided a table with page_id, event_timestamp and flag - on/off.
Find the number of pages that are currently on.

Assumption - Select primary key of this table. 
(page_id, event timestamp)
are primary keys that means each combination of them is unique.

step 1 - filter page_ids based on current event timestamp
step 2 - filter pages that are having flag = on
step 3 - count num of pages.

select count(*) as num_on
from t
where event_timestamp = now()
and flag = 'on'

step 4 - How do you plan to improve the efficiency of the current code?
